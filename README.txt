Here's what was modified:

Initialization of Message History: Initialized self.message_history in the Agent class.

Refined Message Method: Modified how messages are processed and stored in history.

Removed Undefined Variables: I've removed the undefined all_header and clarified the reading of the headers.

Stopping Criterion: The loop now has a max turn limit, so it doesn't go on indefinitely. You can adjust this as necessary.

Saving Conversations: I've made sure that both the GM's and Player's conversations are saved at the end of the loop.

Note: This is a basic structure to get you started. You might want to add game-specific logic, character progression, and other game mechanics as mentioned in previous answers.
